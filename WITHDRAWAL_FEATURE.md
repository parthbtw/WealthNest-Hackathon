# Withdrawal Functionality with 0.5% Fee - Implementation Guide

## Overview
The withdrawal functionality has been successfully implemented for Micro-Savings and Emergency vaults with a 0.5% withdrawal fee. The Pension Nest vault remains locked (no withdrawals allowed) to ensure retirement security.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **User Interface**
- **Withdraw Button**: Clicking the "üíµ Withdraw" button reveals an inline withdrawal form
- **Withdrawal Form**: 
  - Clean, styled input field for entering withdrawal amount
  - Real-time fee calculation display
  - "Confirm" button to process the withdrawal
  - "Cancel" button to close the form
  - Helpful placeholder text and validation messages
  - Disabled state during processing to prevent double submissions

### 2. **Fee System**
- **Fee Rate**: 0.5% of the withdrawal amount
- **Fee Calculation**: `fee = withdrawal_amount * 0.005`
- **Total Deduction**: `withdrawal_amount + fee`
- **Real-time Display**: Fee and total deduction shown as user types

### 3. **Validation**
- **Amount Validation**: Ensures withdrawal amount is greater than $0
- **Balance Check**: Verifies withdrawal amount doesn't exceed current balance
- **Fee Inclusion Check**: Ensures total deduction (amount + fee) doesn't exceed balance
- **User-Friendly Errors**: Clear error messages for invalid inputs

### 4. **Database Operations**
The withdrawal function performs three database operations in sequence:

#### a. Update Vault Balance
```javascript
// Updates the balance in the vaults table
// Subtracts total deduction (withdrawal amount + fee)
const newBalance = currentBalance - totalDeduction

await supabase
  .from('vaults')
  .update({ balance: newBalance })
  .eq('id', vault.id)
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
```

#### b. Create Withdrawal Transaction Record
```javascript
// Inserts a withdrawal transaction record with NEGATIVE amount
await supabase
  .from('transactions')
  .insert({
    user_id: user.id,
    vault_id: vault.id,
    amount: -amount,  // Negative to indicate withdrawal
    description: `Withdrawal from ${vaultName}`,
  })
```

#### c. Create Fee Transaction Record
```javascript
// Inserts a fee transaction record with NEGATIVE amount
await supabase
  .from('transactions')
  .insert({
    user_id: user.id,
    vault_id: vault.id,
    amount: -fee,  // Negative to indicate deduction
    description: `${vaultName} withdrawal fee`,
  })
```

### 5. **User Feedback**
- **Success Message**: Green notification confirming withdrawal with fee amount and amount received
- **Error Messages**: 
  - "Please enter a valid amount greater than $0"
  - "Insufficient funds. You cannot withdraw more than your current balance."
  - "Insufficient funds including fee. Fee: $X.XX. Total needed: $X.XX."
- **Auto-Refresh**: Balance updates immediately after successful withdrawal
- **Auto-Hide**: Success message disappears after 5 seconds
- **Fee Disclosure**: Informational box explaining 0.5% fee for Emergency vault

### 6. **Real-Time Fee Calculator**
As the user types the withdrawal amount, the UI displays:
- Calculated fee (0.5%)
- Total deduction (amount + fee)
- Yellow informational box with fee breakdown

## How to Test

### Prerequisites
1. Make sure you've run the SQL schema in your Supabase project
2. Create a test account and log in
3. Deposit some funds into the Emergency or Micro-Savings vault first

### Testing Steps - Emergency Vault

#### Step 1: Deposit Funds
1. Navigate to the **Emergency Vault**
2. Click **"üí∏ Deposit"**
3. Enter `1000.00`
4. Click **"Confirm"**
5. Verify balance shows $1,000.00

#### Step 2: Test Withdrawal
1. Click **"üíµ Withdraw"**
2. Enter `100.00`
3. Observe the fee calculator:
   - Withdrawal fee (0.5%): $0.50
   - Total deduction: $100.50
4. Click **"Confirm"**
5. Verify:
   - Success message shows: "Withdrawal successful. Fee applied: $0.50. You received $100.00."
   - Balance updates to $899.50 (1000 - 100 - 0.50)

#### Step 3: Test Edge Cases
**Test 1: Insufficient Funds**
1. Try to withdraw $900.00
2. Fee would be $4.50
3. Total needed: $904.50
4. Current balance: $899.50
5. Error: "Insufficient funds including fee. Fee: $4.50. Total needed: $904.50."

**Test 2: Exact Balance Withdrawal**
1. Current balance: $899.50
2. Calculate maximum withdrawal: `(899.50 / 1.005) = $894.53`
3. Withdraw $894.53
4. Fee: $4.47
5. Total: $899.00
6. Should succeed!

**Test 3: Zero or Negative Amount**
1. Try to withdraw $0 or leave empty
2. Error: "Please enter a valid amount greater than $0"

## Technical Details

### State Management
The component uses React hooks to manage:
- `withdrawalAmount` - User input value
- `showWithdrawForm` - Toggle between button and form view
- `success` - Success message text
- `error` - Error message text
- `processing` - Loading state during API calls

### Fee Calculation Logic
```javascript
const amount = parseFloat(withdrawalAmount)
const currentBalance = parseFloat(vault.balance)

// Calculate 0.5% fee
const fee = amount * 0.005

// Calculate total deduction
const totalDeduction = amount + fee

// Validate sufficient funds
if (totalDeduction > currentBalance) {
  setError(`Insufficient funds including fee. Fee: ${formatCurrency(fee)}. Total needed: ${formatCurrency(totalDeduction)}.`)
  return
}
```

### Transaction Recording
Withdrawal transactions are recorded as **negative amounts** to distinguish them from deposits:
- **Deposit**: `amount: 100.00` (positive)
- **Withdrawal**: `amount: -100.00` (negative)
- **Fee**: `amount: -0.50` (negative)

This allows for easy calculation of net balance and transaction history filtering.

### Error Handling
- All database operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Errors are logged to console for debugging
- User-friendly error messages are displayed in the UI
- Failed operations don't leave the database in an inconsistent state
- Rollback would be needed for production (implement transactions)

### Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure users can only update their own vaults
- User authentication is verified before any database operations
- Input validation prevents invalid data from being submitted
- Fee calculation is done server-side (in this case, client validates but server could re-verify)

## Vault-Specific Behavior

### Micro-Savings Vault
- ‚úÖ Withdrawals allowed
- ‚úÖ 0.5% fee applied
- Purpose: Encourage saving, small fee for liquidity

### Emergency Vault
- ‚úÖ Withdrawals allowed
- ‚úÖ 0.5% fee applied
- Purpose: Available for emergencies, fee discourages non-emergency use
- Informational notice displayed about fee

### Pension Nest
- ‚ùå Withdrawals NOT allowed
- üîí Time-locked until retirement
- Button shows: "üîí Locked until retirement"
- Informational notice explains time-lock

## User Experience Flow

### Normal Withdrawal Flow
1. User clicks "üíµ Withdraw" button
2. Withdrawal form appears with input field
3. User enters amount (e.g., $100.00)
4. Real-time fee calculator shows:
   - Fee: $0.50
   - Total: $100.50
5. User clicks "Confirm"
6. Processing state (button disabled, shows "Processing...")
7. Three database operations complete
8. Success message appears
9. Balance updates on screen
10. Form closes automatically
11. Input field clears

### Error Handling Flow
1. User enters invalid amount
2. Error message appears in red box
3. User corrects the amount
4. Error clears when user submits again

## Future Enhancements
- Transaction history display with withdrawals and fees shown separately
- Variable fee rates based on vault type or user tier
- Fee-free withdrawal allowances (e.g., 2 free withdrawals per month)
- Withdrawal limits per time period
- Email notifications for withdrawals
- SMS verification for large withdrawals
- Export transaction history to CSV/PDF
- Analytics dashboard showing fees paid over time

## Formula Reference

### Calculate Fee
```
fee = withdrawal_amount √ó 0.005
```

### Calculate Total Deduction
```
total_deduction = withdrawal_amount + fee
```

### Calculate Maximum Withdrawable Amount
```
max_withdrawal = current_balance √∑ 1.005
```

Example:
- Balance: $1,000.00
- Max withdrawal: $1,000 √∑ 1.005 = $995.02
- Fee on max: $995.02 √ó 0.005 = $4.98
- Total: $995.02 + $4.98 = $1,000.00 ‚úÖ
